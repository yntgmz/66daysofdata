Reading: Scaping Flatland, Chapter 1, Envisioning Information-Edward R. Tufte

Design Srategies to:
 1. Increase the number of dimensions represented on a plane
 - Direct methods include: making models, stero illustrations, 
-dimensionality and data compression
-
 2. Increase data density, the amount of information per unit area:
 -small multiples, efficient and convincing summaries of data, making the same point again and again by offering complementary variations on the major substantive theme
 -parallel sequencing 
-micro and macro displays combining pattern and detail , combining  average and variation
-layering and separation of data
-multiplying of images, color, narratives of space and time

Point of inspiration:
Study the causes of variation -standard deviation- of a variable
"If the numbers are boring, then you've got the wrong numbers."
